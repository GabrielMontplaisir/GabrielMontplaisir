Welcome to my Github! This is my portfolio, an amalgamation of side projects to document my own learning, and to share with everyone. The goal is to improve technological literacy for myself, for educators, and the general population. I want to share my knowledge, my discoveries, and the tools I create. I hope, in turn,  this ripples into a self-interest for others to learn themselves. I believe in the power of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to get it done. What better
way to learn about something than when it's freely available to use and explore? Grab a pen and paper, a notebook, open up your favourite text editor, and let's learn together! 

There are plenty of things I want to do and show off down the pipeline. I hope I have the time and energy to accomplish them all. In the meantime, feel free to peruse through my notes and other projects I've developed!
